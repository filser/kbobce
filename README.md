# kbobce
A script to use the Belgian KBO/BCE PUBLIC Search Webservice

The script is intended to obtain base company information based on a KBO/BCE identifier

Heavily inspired on the script example written by Alain Tiemblo on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/953639/connecting-to-ws-security-protected-web-service-with-php/18575154#18575154)
